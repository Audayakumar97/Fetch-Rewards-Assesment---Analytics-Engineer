# Project Documentation Overview

**Summary**
This repository contains the comprehensive analysis and data transformation processes conducted on the Fetch Rewards datasets, focusing on receipts, users, and brands. 
The primary objective was to convert unstructured JSON data into structured formats suitable for further analysis and reporting.

**Details of the Repository Contents**
## Fetch Rewards Assesment Python Notebook: 
The majority of the data processing and analytical queries are executed within an iPython notebook. 
This includes detailed answers to the exercise prompts and the required Python code to transform unstructured JSON files into structured relational data, perform sql queries for the given questions and
Data quality issues and checks.

## Data Model: 
An entity-relationship diagram (Fetch_datamodel.png) is included in the repository. This diagram visually represents the structured data model derived from the initial unstructured JSON files, 
providing a clear schema for how data tables are related.

## Stakeholder Communication: 
Communication with stakeholders is crucial. An md file (stakeholder_email.md) contains a drafted email, detailing the findings from the data analysis and any concerns regarding data quality and structure. 
This communication is intended to inform and engage stakeholders about the insights derived and the methodologies used.
